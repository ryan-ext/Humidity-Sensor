# Humidity-Sensor

This integrates BME280 and SHT40 breakout boards and ESP32-S2 QT PY microcontrollers from Adafruit into a 3D printed case to create a wireless temperature and humidity sensor.

The accuracy of these sensors was determined by comparing the measured values to a reference relative humidity created using a wet or saturated salt, which regulates the RH within a small airtight enclosure by absorbing or releasing moisture. Over time, each salt will reach a different equilibrium relative humidity with the enclosed air, which is also affected by temperature. The sensors were placed in a sealed 2-liter plastic food container with one of the reference salts weighed into a dish. The amount of salt used can be varied (10 - 20 grams), but generally more salt should be used when the reference relative humidity will be significantly lower than the ambient relative humidity.
